# Goad

<https://goad.io>

Goad is an AWS Lambda powered, highly distributed,
load testing tool built in Go for the 2016 [Gopher Gala][].

![Go + Load ⇒ Goad](https://goad.io/assets/go-plus-load.png)

Goad allows you to load test your websites from all over the world whilst costing you the tiniest fractions of a penny by using AWS Lambda in multiple regions simultaneously.

You can run Goad from your machine using your own AWS credentials. Goad will automatically create the AWS resources you need and execute your test, and display the results broken down by region. This way, you can see how fast your website is from the major regions of the world.

If you just want to try Goad out, visit the [Goad.io website](https://goad.io) and enter the address of the site you want to test.

## Installation

### Binary

The easiest way is to download a pre-built binary from [Goad.io] or from the [GitHub Releases][] page.

### From source

To build the Goad CLI from scratch, make sure you have a working Go 1.5 workspace ([instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install)), then:


1. Fetch the project with `go get`:

  ```sh
  go get github.com/goadapp/goad
  ```

2. Install Go [bindata][]:

  ```sh
  go get -u github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/...
  ```

3. Run make to build for all supported platforms

  ```sh
  make
  ```

  Alternatively, run append `osx`, `linux`, or `windows` to just build for one platform, for example:

  ```sh
  make osx
  ```

4. You'll find your `goad` binary in the `build` folder…

## Usage

### AWS credentials

Goad will read your credentials from `~/.aws/credentials` or from the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables ([more info](http://blogs.aws.amazon.com/security/post/Tx3D6U6WSFGOK2H/A-New-and-Standardized-Way-to-Manage-Credentials-in-the-AWS-SDKs)).

### CLI

```sh
# Get help:
$ goad --help
usage: goad [<flags>] [<url>]

An AWS Lambda powered load testing tool

Flags:
  -h, --help                     Display usage information (this message)
  -n, --requests=2000            Number of requests to perform. Set to 0 in combination with a specified timelimit allows for unlimited requests for the specified time.
  -c, --concurrency=10           Number of multiple requests to make at a time
  -t, --timelimit=3600           Seconds to max. to spend on benchmarking
  -s, --timeout=15               Seconds to max. wait for each response
  -H, --header=HEADER ...        Add Arbitrary header line, eg. 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' (repeatable)
  -m, --method="GET"             HTTP method
      --body=BODY                HTTP request body
      --json-output=JSON-OUTPUT  Optional path to file for JSON result storage
      --region=us-east-1 ...     AWS regions to run in. Repeat flag to run in more then one region. (repeatable)
      --run-docker               execute in docker container instead of aws lambda
      --create-ini-template      create sample configuration file "goad.ini" in current working directory
  -V, --version                  Show application version.

Args:
  [<url>]  [http[s]://]hostname[:port]/path optional if defined in goad.ini

# For example:
$ goad -n 1000 -c 5 -u https://example.com
```

Note that sites such as https://google.com that employ redirects cannot be tested correctly at this time.

### Settings

Goad supports to load settings stored in an ini file. It looks
for a goad.ini file in the current working directory. Flags set on the command-line will
be overwrite these settings.

```ini
[general]
#url = http://example.com/
timeout = 3600
concurrency = 10
requests = 1000
timelimit = 15
json-output = test-result.json
method = GET
body = Hello world

[regions]
us-east-1 ;N.Virginia
#us-east-2 ;Ohio
#us-west-1 ;N.California
#us-west-2 ;Oregon
eu-west-1 ;Ireland
#eu-central-1 ;Frankfurt
#ap-southeast-1 ;Singapore
#ap-southeast-2 ;Tokio
#ap-northeast-1 ;Sydney
#ap-northeast-2 ;Seoul
#sa-east-1 ;Sao Paulo

[headers]
cache-control: no-cache
auth-token: YOUR-SECRET-AUTH-TOKEN
```

### Docker

Goad can also be run as a Docker container which exposes the web API:

    docker run --name goad --rm -dit -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your key ID> -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your key> goad /bin/bash

Access into the container
    
    docker exec -it goad bash
    goad -n 1000 -c 5 https://example.com
    
## How it works

Goad takes full advantage of the power of Amazon Lambdas and Go's concurrency for distributed load testing. You can use Goad to launch HTTP loads from up to four AWS regions at once. Each lambda can handle hundreds of concurrent connections, we estimate that Goad should be able to achieve peak loads of up to **100,000 concurrent requests**.

![Goad diagram](https://goad.io/assets/diagram.svg)

Running Goad will create the following AWS resources:

- An IAM Role for the lambda function.
- An IAM Role Policy that allows the lambda function to send messages to SQS, to publish logs and to spawn new lambda in case an individual lambda times out on a long running test.
- A lambda function.
- An SQS queue for the test.

A new SQS queue is created for each test run, and automatically deleted after the test is completed. The other AWS resources are reused in subsequent tests.

## How it was built

### Go CLI and server

* [AWS SDK for Go][]
* [Gorilla WebSocket][]
* [Termbox][]
* [UUID][]
* [bindata][]

### Goad executable

Written in pure Go, Goad takes care of instantiating all the AWS resources, collecting results and displaying them. Interestingly, it contains the executable of the Lambda worker, which is also written in Go.

There is also a webapi version, which can be used to serve Goad as a web service. This streams the results using WebSockets.

### Lambda workers

AWS Lambda instances are bootstrapped using node.js but the actual work on the Lambda instances is performed by a Go process. The HTTP
requests are distributed among multiple Lambda instances each running multiple concurrent goroutines, in order to achieve the desired
concurrency level with high throughput.
